# Tap-Pass
## Problem Statement:
In modern office environments, traditional entry systems often rely on physical keycards, which can be easily lost or duplicated, posing security risks and causing inconvenience. 
Additionally, employees frequently need quick access to their daily meeting schedules upon entry, but current systems do not
provide this integration efficiently. There is a need for a secure, convenient, and integrated solution that leverages existing smartphone technology to streamline entry processes and provide immediate access to essential information, even in
offline scenarios

## Proposed Solution:
Develop an NFC Entry System that utilizes smartphones as entry cards.
This system will:
- Enable automatic verification and entry through NFC technology.
- Store user verification details, office updates and meeting schedules securely.
- Provide instant access to meeting information upon entry.
- Operate seamlessly both online and offline.
- Integrate fingerprint authentication for enhanced security

## TechStack:
- Languages: Kotlin Multiplatform
- Frameworks: JetPack Compose Multiplatform
- Backend: Firebase
- Database: Firestore.
- Technology: NFC
